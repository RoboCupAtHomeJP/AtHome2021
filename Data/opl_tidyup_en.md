### Scoring Team
- One member of your team (Scorer A) and one member of another team (Scorer B) will score the robot.
- The two members of the scoring team will summarize their opinions and submit the scores to the OPL committee.
- On-site team scoring
  - Scorer A:  A member of the team
  - Scorer B:  A member of another on-site team

- Online team scoring
  - Scorer A:  A member of the team
  - Scorer B:  A member of one of the two on-site teams
  - Scoring of the online team by the on-site team will be done through the camera.  Online teams should move the camera position for easy scoring.


### About Basic Functionalities
- Time will be measured by both Scorer A and Scorer B.
- How to set up the room is as shown in [this file](./BFArena_y1.pdf)

#### Pick and Place
- The objects to be placed and the order in which they will be placed will be given by the OPL committee just before the competition.

#### Avoid That
- Tasks will be performed in the order described in the rulebook.
  - Last year, the order of tasks was different for each team, but this year it will not be the same last year.

#### What Did You Say?
- The position of the questioner will be indicated by the OPL committee just before the competition.
- The questioner should be selected from the members of your team.

### About Tidy Up for OPL

#### People in the Delivery area
- People in the delivery area: Only two people are allowed in the delivery area, and they must be seated on chairs. These two people should be selected from your team.
  - The OPL committee will tell you which person on the left or right side will be the one to wave their hands just before the start of Tidy Up for OPL.

#### Preparation of the field

- 30 minutes before the start, the OPL committee will share the "Object Placement List". Teams place objects according to this "Object Placement List".
  - "Object Placement List" specifies where to place the objects and the order in which to place them.
  - The team may consider how to place the objects (orientation, etc.) so that the robot can easily pick them up.
  - Unknown objects will be announced along with "Object Placement List".
  - "Object Placement List" should be the same for all three teams performing the task.
  - The scoring team will check if the object placement is done correctly.
